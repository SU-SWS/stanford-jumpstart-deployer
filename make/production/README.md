# Production Make Files

Use these make files to build out the latest production tags of the product
stack. Good for deploying new sites and working out hotfixes. Avoid using
branches and development versions of modules in these make files.

eg: drush make jumpstart.make /htdocs/website

# Production Tags

You can find previous releases for each product in the tags directory.
